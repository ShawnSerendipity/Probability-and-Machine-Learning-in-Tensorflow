# Probability-and-Machine-Learning-in-Tensorflow
This is the course project of Uncertainty Evaluation in Engineering Measurements and Machine Learning, which includes:
- Implementing statistical models to perform statistical analysis based on given dataset using Tensorflow and PyMC3
- Implementing Bayesian Machine Learning algorithms and their optimization methods based on tulip dataset using Tensorflow and Scikit-learn, which finally achieve 95% accuracy
